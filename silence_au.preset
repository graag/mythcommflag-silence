# presets for silence.py
# use comma separated values: defaults are used for absent values
# For titles/callsign the name is a python regular expressions, case is ignored.
# Re Metachars are # . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
# If a title contains one of these, then escape it (using \) or replace it with full stop
# Names are matched to the START of a title/callsign so "e4" also matches "e4+1"
# First name match is used so put specific presets (ie. programmes) before general ones (channels)
